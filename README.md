### Data cleaning and Preparation
- Text Cleaning: In data cleaning and preparation the gender column contains male, female, and blank so i replaced the blank with undisclosed using replace values.
- Department column: There are few cells that has "NULL" text, so i removed them by unchecking the list rows.
- Salary Column: There are cells that has "NULL" text in the column, so it was removed by unchecking it from the list of salary rows.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and department.
- Show insight on rating based on gender.
- Analyse the company's salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management.
